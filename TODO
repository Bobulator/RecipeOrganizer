BUGS:
[X] In the create recipe page the remove ingredient button currently doesn't work. FIXED: cBacon
[X] In the create recipe page, when you click on the add ingredient button the first time the next ingredient gets displayed right below the previous one without an padding. FIXED: cBacon

Misc:
[ ] Add validation to the create recipe page. Specifically, require the title, ingredients, and instruction fields to be filled before submit. Also, add length restraints to each field, especially the title and description fields since those are used in the cell views.
[ ] Move the .js sources and other dependencies to the bottom of each page so that the navbar loads faster.
[ ] Make the login and register pages more presentable (need to establish a look and feel for the whole site before doing this)
[X] Make usernames case sensitive (so Bob and bob would be considered the same user). Delete duplicate usernames from the database. FIXED: cBacon (Note: only the registration page is case-insensitive. When logging in you still need to use the correct username)
[ ] Update current view files to reference local installations of Jquery and Angular (this will help reduce overall latency).
[X] In the create recipe page, change the units input form into a dropdown menu. FIXED: cBacon
[X] In the create recipe page, find a better plus glyphicon for the add ingredient button. FIXED: cBacon
[ ] In the create recipe page, fill the top-right of the page with an image placeholder.
[ ] Find a clean way to fit the theme of each recipe in their respective thumbnails on the home and advanced search views.
[ ] Allow for multiple ingredients to be listed in the advanced search page.
[ ] Add a button that will display a recipe in a new tab; add a printer friendly recipe page.
[ ] Refactor the way recipe thumbnails are generated in the search and home screens since there is quite a bit of code duplication. Perhaps abstract the function that populates each thumbnail or even the thumbnail template.
