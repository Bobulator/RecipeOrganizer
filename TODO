BUGS:
[ ] In the create recipe page the remove ingredient button currently doesn't work.
[X] In the create recipe page, when you click on the add ingredient button the first time the next ingredient gets displayed right below the previous one without an padding. FIXED: cBacon

Misc:
[ ] Make the login and register pages more presentable (need to establish a look and feel for the whole site before doing this)
[ ] Make usernames case sensitive (so Bob and bob would be considered the same user). Delete duplicate usernames from the database.
[ ] Update current view files to reference local installations of Jquery and Angular (this will help reduce overall latency).
[X] In the create recipe page, change the units input form into a dropdown menu. FIXED: cBacon
[X] In the create recipe page, find a better plus glyphicon for the add ingredient button. FIXED: cBacon
[ ] In the create recipe page, fill the top-right of the page with an image placeholder.
